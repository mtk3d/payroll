# Payroll 💸

Small application built for manage employments, and generate salary reports.

## 📝 Assumptions

- Application is built using as many patterns and good practices as possible in a finite time
- Report generating process is ready to run it asynchronously
- Framework installation deferred as long as possible, use framework-agnostic approach
- App has a basic C4 model and EventStorming session output
- Employee must be attached to Department
- Report read model must be as simple as possible, like simple single database table
- App frontend must be simple as possible using basic tools, like CSS and JS framework from cdn

## 🚀 Setup local environment

Just run

```shell
make up
```

this command will build and create entire docker environment, and will load database fixtures

## 🧪 Run tests

To run functional tests, you have to go inside docker shell

```shell
make shell
```

and then

```shell
make test
```

or you can run only specific type tests

```shell
make test-all
make test-unit
make test-integration
make test-functional
```

If you're not using docker environment, you have to load fixtures before running functional tests

```shell
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

## 🧑‍🚀 Other usefully commands

```shell
Usage:
  make TARGET

Targets:
  up          Up and run docker environment
  shell       Go inside docker container
  lint        Execute all available linters
  fix         Fix all code formatting problems
  test        Run tests
  test-%      Run specific tests `test-[all|unit|integration|functional]`

```
